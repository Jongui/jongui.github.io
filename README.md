# jongui.github.io

This is the site I've created to show my different projects. Working as SAP/ABAP Developer gave the opportunity to get in touch with a lot of business process and many kinds of technology. Also, I am still working with it, I'm always interested in different kind of development and therefor started to learn other programming languages and frameworks. This led me to the stuff you will find here. Some of them are programming tutorials that I enhanced and others are researches I started for some educational purposes. So, what you will find here are links to my GitHub projects that are organized following the order of the navigation bar right on top of this page. Please, feel free to navigate in the site and if you would like to offer me a 300K job or work together in some project or simply get in touch to exchange some experiences feel free to send me an email! You will find it on the Contact section of the site! You can also follow me on GitHub if you like!
