I am a Mennonite and am very interested in the Mennonite History. I've found <a href="https://www.germansfromrussiasettlementlocations.org/" target="_blank">this site</a> and <a href="http://chort.square7.ch/">this one</a> with maps of Mennonite Settlements in Russia.
This app is actually the iOS version of the <a href="">MennoMaps</a> app for Android I'm currently developing. It is powered by MapKit and will be available soon at the AppleStore! The 1.0.0 version of the app is ready and soon you can download it!
