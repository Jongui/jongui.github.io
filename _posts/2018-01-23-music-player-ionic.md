This is the front-end of my project for Universisdade Tecnológica do Paraná. I made it with Ionic because I wanted the same app for Android and iOS user. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZ9v1y-iWH8" target="_blank">Here</a> you can find a video in Portuguease about it. If you wish to see the source code, please go to the <a href="https://github.com/Jongui/MusicPlayerIonic" target="_blank">project repository</a>.
