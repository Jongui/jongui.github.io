I am a Mennonite and am very interested in the Mennonite History. I've found <a href="https://www.germansfromrussiasettlementlocations.org/" target="_blank">this site</a> and <a href="http://chort.square7.ch/">this one</a> with maps of Mennonite Settlements in Russia. So I took the info in these sites and created this app. I also added some Settlements in South America and am searching for more places. See the <a href="https://github.com/Jongui/MennoMapsAndroid">repository page</a> on GitHub for more information or install it from <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.joaogd53.mennomaps&hl=en">GooglePlay</a>.
