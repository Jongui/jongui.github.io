This was the project I've made for my wedding ceremony. The intention was to build a channel to communicate with the guest in a more personal way. It had some information about the ceremony itself, but also about the guests, stores where the gift list were and the story of our lives. Please, navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/Jongui/OurWedding2" target="_blank">project's page</a> for more information!
