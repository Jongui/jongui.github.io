<h2>Cordova</h2>

My first contact with Cordova was at the beginning of 2017. What I liked the most was the possibility to have the same layout for any application. This was particularly interesting for my research of a mobile app for collective music making!

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
    {% for post in site.categories.cordova %}
    <li>
        <h3 href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</h3>
        {{ post.content }}
    </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
