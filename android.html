<h2>Android</h2>
<p>I remember to start developing for Android with a typical HelloWorld program, which is not that hard with AndroidStudio, in 2014. Since then I have move from an Eclipse environment to the AndroidStudio and also learn how to version control with GitHub. Today, I have one project available at Google Play Store and another one that I had to terminate :(. Find a bit more abour them below and, if you want, go to the app repository.</p>
