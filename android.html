<h2>Android</h2>
<p>I remember to start developing for Android with a typical HelloWorld program, which is not that hard with AndroidStudio, in 2014. Since then I have move from an Eclipse environment to the AndroidStudio and also learn how to version control with GitHub. Today, I have one project which made it to the Google App Store! Below you made find this project description and, if you wish, you can navigate to the project's page!</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
